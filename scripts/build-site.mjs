      sec("Look past the headline commission split", "A high split can still be expensive if monthly fees, transaction fees, technology fees, desk fees, E&O charges, and marketing requirements are not clear. A lower split can still be valuable if it includes real coaching and transaction support. Compare the full annual cost under realistic production scenarios.", ["Estimate one rental, one buyer transaction, one listing, and one referral.", "Ask which fees are due monthly and which are due at closing.", "Confirm whether fees continue when you are inactive."]),

      sec("What flat fee usually means", "Flat fee does not mean free, risk-free, or identical across companies.

      sec("Why agents consider it", "Agents often compare flat-fee models when they want more predictable costs or when they already generate their own business. The appeal is straightforward: if production is consistent and support needs are manageable, fixed costs may be easier to plan around than percentage splits.", ["Predictable cost structure", "More control over retained commission after fees", "Potential fit for referral-heavy or repeat-client business"]),
      sec("Where the tradeoffs show up", "The lowest fee is not automatically the best business decision. If you are new, need hands-on contract help, or do not yet understand local transaction customs, the cost of weak support can outweigh savings.

Estimate gross commission, brokerage split, transaction fees, monthly fees, MLS dues, association dues, marketing costs, and taxes. Then compare annual net before personal expenses and taxes. Do not rely on a single best-case closing.", ["One low-price rental", "One buyer-side sale", "One listing-side sale", "One referral-only commission"]),
